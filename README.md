## Other Notes

This was a fun one, and ended up being much simpler than I expected. I think I really wrapped my head around when to and not to lift state and how to effectively use the useEffect hook. Chakra-UI made it really easy to make it nice looking, and I think I definitely prefer the workflow to Tailwind at the moment. Thinking in React is really starting to click.
